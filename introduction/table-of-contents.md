### Before reading

If you are viewing this PDR in [gitbook](https://coen-beemer.gitbook.io/pdr-minor-ai), you will see checkmarks beside the learning outcomes in the index on the left. This is what those checkmarks mean:

* Black checkmark - This learning outcome is at proficient
* Blue checkmark - This learning outcome is at proficient but I believe this could be at Advanced
* Green checkmark - This learning outcome is at Advanced (already in canvas)
