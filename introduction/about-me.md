# About me

Hi, my name is Coen Beemer. I'm a student at FHICT where I chose the Technology specialization.

My passions are robotics and gaming.&#x20;

I'm going to be brutally honest, I didn't plan on choosing this minor at first. The only reason I chose this minor was because I was late choosing one and this one seemed the most interesting out of the ones that were still available. I also think this can be combined well with my expertise in technology/robotics.
