# About me

Hi, my name is Coen Beemer. I'm a student at FHICT where I chose the Technology specialization.

My passions are robotics and gaming.&#x20;

I went into this minor without any Python experience(my main expertise lies in C++), which took some getting used to.

I didn't plan on choosing this minor at first. I chose this minor was because I was late choosing one and this one seemed the most interesting out of the ones that were still available. I also think this can be combined well with my expertise in technology/robotics, as cooperative robots are something I have done projects about before where I think AI could help a lot.
