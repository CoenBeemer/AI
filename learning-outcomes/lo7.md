## Learning Process

### First Evaluation: Week 4

This week we actually started work on the group project by talking about the concept and making lists of questions we had for the client and teachers. I initialized the conversations to plan meetings as nobody else was doing it at the time.

#### Self Assessment: Orienting



### Second Evaluation: Week 11

As discussed during the semester evaluation and before that with Danny, I am one of the few students to regularly work at campus outside of group project times. I also have one of the highest amount of feedpulse checkpoints(that I know of), which shows I keep regular contact with the consultants to show my work. With this, I feel like I show professional work ethics and with that I think that should be enough to get this learning outcome to beginning.

#### Self Assessment: Beginning

### How I will show this learning outcome

I believe I will be able to show this learning outcome at a proficient level by keeping up my attendance and by keeping regular feedback moments with the consultants.
