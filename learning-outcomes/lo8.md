## Learning outcome description

~~The student is able to train an AI to choose a suitable existing AI from a list to process any given dataset.~~

The student is able to write comprehensive and efficient code with enough documentation and no unnecessary code.

## Learning Process

### First Evaluation: Week 2

This week I talked to several teachers, most of which seemed interested in the project idea. Coen gave me some points to work on/investigate before getting started with making a full project plan.

#### Self Assessment: Orienting

### Second Evaluation: Week 4

This week I started reading up on the technical aspect of this project, also talking to Georgiana about it. She seemed very interested in it, as she did a similar project before. What I did is described in more detail in the [First Evaluation of LO2](lo2.md#first-evaluation-week-4).

#### Self Assessment: Beginning

### Third Evaluation: Week 7

I'm starting to make decent progress on my [personal project goals](../wip-personal-notes/personal-project-proposal.md#current-project-goals-and-status). As seen by the colors in the linked project goals I still feel I'm in the beginning stage, as I haven't done much with regards to AI yet.

#### Self Assessment: Beginning

### Fourth Evaluation: Week 9

The progress on my personal project really stagnated for several weeks as I got a mindblock I couldn't get around. Because of this, I had some talks with Danny(sadly not documented in feedpulse) which resulted in me giving up on my personal project. Because of this, I decided to do several smaller projects to show the learning outcomes. I will also show a lot of my learning outcomes using the group project, which is making more progress than expected.

#### Self Assessment: Beginning

### Fifth Evaluation: Week 16

As I decided to switch this learning outcome around I believe this learning outcome has already been partially shown by [LO3 week 6](lo3.md), as I added a download function to keep data locally instead of using remote sources all the time which caused my code to be a lot faster.

#### Self Assessment: Beginning (but almost proficient)

### How I will show this learning outcome

I believe I will be able to show this learning outcome at a proficient level by cleaning up the group project code.
