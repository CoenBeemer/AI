## Learning Process

### First Evaluation: Week 4

This week I had a talk about the societal impact of my personal project with Georgiana. Apparently she had done a similar project before, but she (jokingly) mentioned she stopped that project as she started to realize she was replacing her own job with an AI. Her project idea was lower level, picking an algorithm and tweaking hyperparameters to make that suitable for training with the provided dataset.&#x20;

I plan on having my idea stay at a higher level, thereby keeping the complexity at a reasonable level for a solo project. My AI will only choose an existing trained model, which can hopefully help people get inspired and interested in AI.

#### Self Assessment: Orienting

### Second Evaluation: Week 7

This week I ran into several problems with my webscraping:

1. It is slow
2. It takes up a lot of memory during runtime

I decided to solve this by implementing an export and optional download of the scraped data for later use

This allows me to run the code even when offline and will also prevent me from artificially inflating the page visits of the used kaggle notebooks. This also prevents me from spamming the kaggle servers too much, which hopefully will prevent me from getting banned because of API overuse.

#### Self Assessment: Beginning

### Third Evaluation: Week 10

A lot has changed since the last evaluation: I decided to change the learning outcomes in smaller projects and the group project to keep my motivation at acceptable levels. I also wrote a document about the impact youtube's algorithms can have and my advise on how that impact can be reduced.&#x20;

#### Self Assessment: Beginning (but almost proficient)&#x20;

### Fourth Evaluation: Week 16

To show this learning outcome I talked to Rens about it and he recommended filling in the [TICT form](https://tict.io/). After filling this in, I sent it back for feedback in which Rens pointed out some concerns which I then addressed in my next version. In combination with showing my previous documents, I believe this is enough to show this learning outcome at a proficient level.

#### Self Assessment: Proficient
