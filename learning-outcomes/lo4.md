# LO4

## Learning outcome description

The student is able to train an algorithm/AI by using datasets and can test if the algorithm/AI has been trained (well) enough to serve its purpose.

## Learning Process

### First Evaluation: Week 4

This week I started looking into a demo given by Georgiana, which includes kNN and decision tree algorithms used for training an AI. you can find what I did in more detail [here](lo3.md#first-evaluation-week-4).

#### Self Assessment: Orienting

### Second Evaluation: Week 10

As explained in [LO2 week 10](lo2.md#second-evaluation-week-10) I started training an AI for predicting scores of IGN reviews based on the features of the game. I did start off with a flop, my data didn't really seem to have any correlation to the result I wanted to predict as you can see in the visuals in [LO3 week 10](lo3.md#third-evaluation-week-10).

#### Self Assessment: Beginning

### Third Evaluation: Week 12

For the group project I wanted to make an AI to detect stress levels. For this I trained an AI on (bad) data from the client, which has a good accuracy without overfitting as it works on multiple datasets without retraining.

### How I will show this learning outcome

I believe I will be able to show this learning outcome at a proficient level with the group project, as I got some recommendations from Georgiana for AI models that could be useful. I will explore these models and try to apply them in the group project if possible.
