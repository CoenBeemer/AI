## Learning Process

### First Evaluation: Week 4

This week I started reading up on model selection and hyperparameter tuning for my personal project, as this was advised to me by Georgiana. I eventually decided to start playing around with [this tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhskaggle/l09-model-selection-and-hyperparameter) from kaggle, which can be found [here](https://github.com/CoenBeemer/AI/commit/48f0454c0f0879a0006b39099ac4c64ce9e20bba). I also started looking at the processes for data preperation by looking at a demo also given by Georgiana which can be found [here](https://github.com/CoenBeemer/AI/commit/4f88cc582792aa2257a51edcb2019e0e5fe54a6e).
