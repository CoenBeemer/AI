## Learning Process

### First Evaluation: Week 7

I made several data visualisations for the data gathered from the web scraping. I made several bar graphs and boxplots in an attempt to figure out relations in the data which my AI could use as indicators for certain datatypes. My data is a bit skewed, as my data has been filtered on one of these tags (I think you can guess which one).
