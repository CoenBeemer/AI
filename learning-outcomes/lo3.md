### First Evaluation: Week 4

I started looking into the processes for data preperation by playing with a demo given by Georgiana which can be found [here](https://github.com/CoenBeemer/AI/commit/4f88cc582792aa2257a51edcb2019e0e5fe54a6e). Along with this I started working on preparing some datasets of my own, which was sadly not as successful as I hoped it would be.
