## Learning Process

### First Evaluation: Week 7

My [documentation ](https://github.com/CoenBeemer/AI/blob/personalProject/doc/README.md)hasn't been updated a lot since I initially set it up and (for now) I don't see any point in doing it as my project is still rapidly changing. The project is starting to take form slowly so I will start updating this more as I make progress.

#### Self Assessment: Orienting

### Second Evaluation: Week 12

My documentation is quite a mess, as I've decided to switch my personal projects. Because of this, I hope to show this learning outcome in the group project and my notebooks instead. I do believe that this PDR with all the links to relevant files should be enough to at least show beginning though.

#### Self Assessment: Beginning

### How I will show this learning outcome

I believe I will be able to show this learning outcome at a proficient level by providing documentation for the group project and my personal projects inside the jupyter notebooks as well as some separate documents where needed. This PDR also shows good documentation because of the easy accessibility and the easy direct links to the work shown.
