## Learning Process

### First Evaluation: Week 7

My [documentation ](https://github.com/CoenBeemer/AI/blob/personalProject/doc/README.md)hasn't been updated a lot since I initially set it up and (for now) I don't see any point in doing it as my project is still rapidly changing. The project is starting to take form slowly so I will start updating this more as I make progress.

#### Self Assessment: Orienting

### Second Evaluation: Week 12

My documentation is quite a mess, as I've decided to switch my personal projects. Because of this, I hope to show this learning outcome in the group project and my notebooks instead. I do believe that this PDR with all the links to relevant files should be enough to at least show beginning though.

### Third Evaluation: Week 16

I've written several documents for the group project, among which are these sections of the reading guide:

I also wrote the accompanying research documents, which can be found in the group project delivery.

During this time I also continued adding documentation with explanations to the jupyter notebooks I was working on, which you can see [here](https://github.com/Inn0/STP1StressVisualisation/blob/levelDetection/StressThreshold.ipynb) in the markdown outlines:

Furthermore, I believe this PDR also shows good documentation because of the easy accessibility and the easy direct links to the work shown. Several teachers have commended me on my use of GitBook, which they were not familiar with but really liked the way it's structured.
