# ðŸ“„ Appendixes

## Personal project(s):

* [OverlordAI](https://github.com/CoenBeemer/AI/tree/personalProject) (unfinished)\
  My initial personal project, which was evenutally dropped because of the complexity. The idea behind this AI is to use classification on input data to find a suitable AI for a large amount of datasets with varying and/or unknown data types. I went into this project with a very optimistic mindset as I didn't know much about AI yet, which caused me to eventually drop this project because it turned out to be too complex for my knowledge at the time.
  * [code](https://github.com/CoenBeemer/AI/blob/personalProject/src/overlordAI.ipynb)\
    The code in the src directory will read the list of models in data/sources/sources.csv to scrape those urls. The scraped data is then processed to extract information for the AI to use. &#x20;
  * [documentation](https://github.com/CoenBeemer/AI/blob/personalProject/doc/README.md)\
    I aimed to make this interactive, as I was inspired by some other well documented git repositories. Because of this it contains a lot of links to other markdown files, which in hindsight I could have done better in gitbook because it would have been less of a hassle and better organized.
* [IGN rating prediction](https://github.com/CoenBeemer/AI/tree/v2) (unfinished)\
  My second personal project, which I dropped because I decided to show most of my learning outcomes in the group project. This project aimed to make an AI to predict the IGN(gaming journailst review) rating.&#x20;
  * [code](https://github.com/CoenBeemer/AI/blob/v2/src/ai.ipynb)
* [Group project data exploration](https://github.com/CoenBeemer/AI/blob/v2/data/DataExploration.pbix)\
  My final personal project in which I explored the data of the group project using powerBI. To do this, I made several visualizations and cleaned the data by analysing those visualisations.

### Separate documents:

* [This PDR](https://coen-beemer.gitbook.io/pdr-minor-ai/introduction/pdr-minor-ai) (on gitbook)\
  Pretty self explanatory, in this PDR I show how I think I showed my learning outcomes during this minor.
* [Export of my feedpulse](https://github.com/CoenBeemer/AI/blob/v2/doc/FeedPulseExport.pdf)\
  A PDF export of all my feedback moments with the teachers.

#### Societal impact documents:

In these documents I aimed to show my societal impact learning outcomes by discussing several subjects.

* [Contemporary philosophy](https://github.com/CoenBeemer/AI/blob/personalProject/doc/societal\_impact/contemporary\_philosophy.md) (unfinished)\
  A document in which I discuss the societal impact of my first personal project.
* [Impact of overfitting](https://github.com/CoenBeemer/AI/blob/v2/doc/impact\_of\_overfitting.docx)\
  A document in which I discuss the societal impact of overfitting AI in general, based around my second personal project.
* [Impact of YouTube algorithms](https://github.com/CoenBeemer/AI/blob/v2/doc/societal\_impact.docx)\
  A document discussing my personal opinion and experience with youtube's algorithms with recommendations on how to solve some of these problems.
* [TICT group project](https://github.com/CoenBeemer/AI/blob/v2/doc/TICT%20Stresspatches%20in%20escaperooms%20FULLSCAN.pdf)\
  A PDF export of the TICT tool which I used to show my societal impact learning outcome based on feedback from Rens.

## Group project:

* [Stress level detection](https://github.com/Inn0/STP1StressVisualisation/tree/levelDetection)\
  The main code of the group project, most of which was made by me.
* [Arima exploration](https://github.com/Inn0/STP1StressVisualisation/tree/arima)\
  A branch of the group project code in which I explored a different AI model for predicting the values.
* [Realtime data](https://github.com/Inn0/STP1StressVisualisation/tree/deepHaven)\
  A branch of the group project code in which I attempted to make the code work with realtime data by using multithreading.
