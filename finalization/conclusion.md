# ðŸ’Ž Conclusion

This semester I learned a lot about how I could use AI and what impact it could have on others. For this I made use of the Python language with several libraries such as pandas, sklearn and more.

I believe I succeeded this minor because I have shown all my learning outcomes to at least a proficient degree, and in my opinion I feel 4 of my learning outcomes are at advanced which would qualify me for an Outstanding.
