# ðŸ•µ Retrospective

Overall I really enjoyed this minor, even though there were some frustrating moments.

In my opinion we lost a lot of time at the start of the semester due to the huge variety of background studies everyone has. I feel like this could be solved by starting off a bit more guided (a lot of people had no idea what they were supposed to be doing the first couple weeks) and setting clear expectations at the start of the semester (aim for at least 1 feedpulse per week etc.).

I also struggled quite a bit with my personal project, eventually completely dropping it altogether. This was because I aimed for the stars and sadly was not quite able to get there. I do think I will try it again later, as by now I've gained a lot more experience with making AI models.&#x20;

One of the things I do think is very unfortunate is the lack of interest the group project client showed by not showing up, breaking promises (giving us a prototype to work with) and giving us data of poor quality and quantity.

About halfway into the semester we started to get less and less workshops, which resulted in a very small amount of people actually working on campus (there were days where I counted 3, which meant more consultants than students were there). I believe this is caused by people getting used to working at home during covid, but by continuing this they leave a lot of opportunities to inspire/help other students like them. I think this can be solved by incentivising them more, wether that is with more workshops or by attaching this to a learning outcome (personal leadership maybe?)

The end of the semester did feel pretty abrupt, as the evaluations were right after the newyear holidays. I feel like it would flow a bit more naturally if some of the deadlines were before these holidays, which would give teachers more time to read everything over and it would give students some more time for corrections as well.

Even through all these struggles, I think this semester was pretty fun and informative. I learned a lot about AI and the responsibilities that come with making/using one. I don't think I will use a lot of the knowledge I gained this semester in my career, as in my opinion so called "black boxes" are pretty much always a bad thing to have.
