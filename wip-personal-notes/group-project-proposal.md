# Group project proposal

## Concept

The patches monitor the stress values of people who are in an escape room to tailor their experience. During an escape room, it can be a goal to keep people on edge to improve the experience. I have experienced escape rooms which contain several "routes" with varying puzzles and/or difficulty. The AI can make people change from one route to another (and thereby changing the difficulty) while still making it appear seamless to the end users. This can be done by changing the outcome of certain puzzles or giving different clues to the next puzzle.

## What problem does it solve?

Escape rooms are often only fun to do once, as then the end users know how to solve the puzzles. If an escape room contains multiple routes then it's still only fun as many times as there is routes. While this increases the "reuseability" of the escape room, it is still limited to the number of routes if there is no dynamic switching between the routes.

## How does it solve it?

The AI monitors the client's vitals which can be translated to a stress level. If the stress level is too high, the AI can give a subtle hint or change to an easier puzzle to lower the difficulty and with that lower the stress levels. If the stress levels are too low the AI can increase the difficulty of the puzzles to keep the room interesting and challenging for everyone.

## Who is it for?

Owners/employees of escaperooms

## Why is my solution the best?

It's original and can make escape room experiences much more interesting and customized so no 2 runs are the same. This can be good for returning customers, which is something escaperooms can struggle with.

## How is AI/data used?

The AI can be used to calculate the optimal difficulty.

## What data(sets) does it use?

It can use the sensor data, as well as inputs from an escape room employee.&#x20;

## What is the possible positive and negative impact?

It can improve the escape room experience, although it might not be the best experience for people who can handle stress very well or not well at all.
