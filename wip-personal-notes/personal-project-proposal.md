# Personal project proposal

## Concept

For this personal project I plan to make an AI which can choose which AI is most suitable depending on what kind of inputs it gets (see example in the image below). This is suitable for people who have a bunch of data but do not know which AI to use to process it.

## What problem does it solve?

I believe this can be useful to find a suitable AI for a large amount of datasets with varying and/or unknown data types.&#x20;

## How does it solve it?

The AI starts by looking at what kind of data it is given. Based on that it can select an AI which can handle such data. For example: if the AI is given an image, it can exclude any AI that has nothing to do with image processing. It can then provide a list of AI's which can give the best result based on user feedback.

## Who is it for?

This AI can be used by people with a large amount of datasets with varying and/or unknown data types. This can help a lot if the user is not very well-versed in AI or doesn't know how an AI can be used to process the data.

## Why is my solution the best?

It is unique. I wasn't able to find anything similar, and it takes out the time someone needs to research which AI can be used for whatever datasets they can throw at it.

## How is AI/data used?

It is used to make a prediction of which AI is the most suitable for the provided data types.

## What data(sets) does it use?

The plan is to make this AI accept any type of dataset, but if this turns out to be a bottleneck the scope can be reduced to fewer data types (e.g. only images or text).

## What is the possible positive and negative impact?

This can improve the speed of people who often have to process a large amount of datasets with varying/unknown data types. Sadly this can also cause those people to become lazy and/or lose their job, as this AI would pretty much do their job for them. It can also help people explore AI for the first time, which can lead to more AI getting used.
