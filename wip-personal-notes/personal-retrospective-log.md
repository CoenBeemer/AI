# Personal retrospective log

## Week 1: start-up

In my opinion this was a REALLY slow start. I understand people from outside FHICT need a couple days to get used to the way stuff works, but we were left pretty much without guidance which led to a lot of people doing nothing during the group project concept phase. From what I could tell this week should have been group brainstorming about ideas for both personal and group project ideas, but no groups were made nor did we get any templates/examples for project proposals.

I also learned we'll only be told about the PDR in week 3, which is very late in my opinion, as during the first couple weeks we should still document in the PDR what we did, which can show a certain baseline for some of the learning outcomes.&#x20;

#### Teacher feedback

I talked to multiple teachers about my personal project concept, and most of them seemed interested in it. \
Kazimier said it was an unique idea and according to Danny it was a realistic concept for which he had a couple ideas which I could expand on. Coen also expressed his interest in the technological aspect of working with many different data types.
