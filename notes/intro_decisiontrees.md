# intro ML classification


supervised learning

- KNN
- Decision trees -> random forest

output type is discrete (class labels)

looking for the decision boundary (boundary where A and B meet)

evaluation for accuracy of the algorithm

best practise: split data in training and test set 80-20%

want to have at least 50k datapoints
