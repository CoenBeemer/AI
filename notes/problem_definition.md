# problem definition

this mf is redpilled

changing the wording of the problem can change the solution drastically

how to make better questions:
- ask better questions: why is this a problem? why is this an answer to that problem? etc.
- Understand the domain the problem is inL talk to ppl in the domain (experts, customers, patients)
- is the problem worth solving?
- don't make the victim a perpetrator(doesn't make them feel better about it)
- simplify the problem
- fight the problem, not symptoms of the problem

find something that's not a problem and solve it.

doing this creates more problems, but often going back isn't an option

efficient/effective is not a value by itself (dependant on opinion)
