# intro ML

categories of machine learning:
1. unsupervised learning
    1. clustering (recommendation based on surrounding data)
    2. dimensionality reduction
2. supervised learning
    - must have labels (know what the expected output should be)
        1. regression (predicting future events based on previous data)
        2. classification (detecting if it's A or B)
3. reinforcement learning (keep trying until it works)

A or B                  Classification algorithm
is this weird?          Anomaly detection algorithm
how much? how many?     regression algorithm
how is this organized?  clustering algorthm
what should I do now?   reinforcement learning algorithm


need a lot of data for machine learning

## ML algorithm categories

ML can be with or without human supervision

can learn incrementally on the fly(online) or not(batch)

compare data points to known points or make predictions (instance-based vs model-based learning)


## methodology
shuffle data so the ai doesn't look at patterns in the data but at the data itself

dataset should be split in train and test data so it has new test data so it can't remember the answer from training data. split about 80-20 training and test data.
