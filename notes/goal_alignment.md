# goal alignment & transparency

transparency as a company:
- honest about shortcomings of the product
- easy to find list of shortcomings
- straight forward on business model
- easy to communnicate with

transparency of technology products is generally really low (no clue why algorithms show you certain stuff)

garbage in, garbage out

accuracy is a tradeoff for transparency (gaydar)

the big danger of AI is believing it works (even when sometimes it doesn't)

ai works best with a clear goal and limited scope(make sure the goal is what you want to achieve)
