# AI, Legal awareness & privacy
[Colette Cuijpers](mailto:Cuijpers@UVT.nl)

why does law matter?
- who is the owner of the algorithm? (school, developer, client)
- licensing/intellectual property
- output of an AI may not be yours, depending on TOS and data used to train it

when does ai become problematic?
- racist/biased

## the input
data used to train the system
scraping photos may not be fair use, opt out is not always easy to establish so should use opt in instead

lawmaking takes about 6 years
ethics are translated into laws eventually
not everything allowed by law may be ethicallly justifiable/acceptable

is input neutral?
data used for training often contains bias/polarization

this can result in legal claims

bias -> difference in cultures, outdated data

think of the consequences of the ai, if it seems harmless here it might be very hurtful somewhere else

is a prediction from an ai enough basis to intervene on a legal basis?

key fundamental rights issue: surveillance (china social score, russian "referendum")

## privacy
is it dead?
it's a fundamental right, it's as dead as we *let it* be
we need to take action to keep it, have to stay sharp
the chance of being surveilled already makes you behave differently

### what is privacy and how to define it?
legal definition: "the right to respect for private life, protection of the home, communication, intimite life and the body."

interests or values protected under right to privacy
- freedom of movement
- autonomy
- undisturbed life
- not to be stigmatised
- not to be manipulated
- self esteem
- equality
- integrity

is privacy the same as data protection?
no, but there is overlap. privacy covers relational, territorial, bodily and informational privacy
informational privacy is covered by data protection.


## privacy vs data protection
part of 2 separate legal frameworks
### privacy:
> art. 8 european convention on human rights
    fundamental right to protect the private sphere
    has exceptions in case of for example interests of national security, public safety, crime prevention

three step test
1. is there a violation of privacy?
2. is the violation in accordance with the law and interest mentioned in art. 8 ECHR?
3. is the violation nessecary in a democratic society? (most important step) decided on:
    - is there a pressing social need?
    - is the measure relevant to its purpose?
    - does it not go beyond what is nessecary to meet its purpose?
    - are there no less invasive alternatives to meet the purpose?(subsidiarity)
    - are the benefits in a reasonalbe proportion to the costs?(proportionality)


### data protection:
> General Data Protection Regulation, REGULATION (EU) 2016/679,(GDPR)
"traffic" rules

you can violate privacy while adhering to data protection regulations (smart meter case)
you can violate data protection regulations while not violating privacy -> e.g. Mr. Cuijpers(woman)


8 principles as foundation of GDPR:
- purpose specification
- use limitation (limit data to only what you need)
- collection limitation
- data quality
- security
- openness
- accountability (let ppl know their data is being used)
- participatory rights (have the right of rectifying or objecting to use of data)

you have to be able to show you comply to GDPR (show you follow all of the above)

important changes:
- extended scope
- more responsibility for data processors
- from compliance to accountability
- higher fines
- more cooperation between Data Protection Authorities

first question to answer: does the GDPR apply?(how to establish this?) -> https://eur-lex.europa.eu/
material scope and territorial scope

not every data processing requires consent

consent should be used as a final resort (because it can be withdrawn)

- a lot of work/investment
information
registers
procedures
effective erasure
proof
consent asked? no other legitimate ground possible
