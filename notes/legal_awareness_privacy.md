# AI, Legal awareness & privacy
[Colette Cuijpers](mailto:Cuijpers@UVT.nl)

why does law matter?
- who is the owner of the algorithm? (school, developer, client)
- licensing/intellectual property
- output of an AI may not be yours, depending on TOS and data used to train it

when does ai become problematic?
- racist/biased

## the input
data used to train the system
scraping photos may not be fair use, opt out is not always easy to establish so should use opt in instead

lawmaking takes about 6 years
ethics are translated into laws eventually
not everything allowed by law may be ethicallly justifiable/acceptable

is input neutral?
data used for training often contains bias/polarization

this can result in legal claims

bias -> difference in cultures, outdated data

think of the consequences of the ai, if it seems harmless here it might be very hurtful somewhere else

is a prediction from an ai enough basis to intervene on a legal basis?

key fundamental rights issue: surveillance (china social score, russian "referendum")

## privacy
is it dead?
it's a fundamental right, it's as dead as we *let it* be
we need to take action to keep it, have to stay sharp
the chance of being surveilled already makes you behave differently

### what is privacy and how to define it?
legal definition: "the right to respect for private life, protection of the home, communication, intimite life and the body."

interests or values protected under right to privacy
- freedom of movement
- autonomy
- undisturbed life
- not to be stigmatised
- not to be manipulated
- self esteem
- equality
- integrity

is privacy the same as data protection?
no, but there is overlap. privacy covers relational, territorial, bodily and informational privacy
informational privacy is covered by data protection.
