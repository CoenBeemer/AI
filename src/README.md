# Overlord AI

I used the AI to choose the AI.

## What does this project aim to do?
Oh no! You mixed up your low-res cat images dataset with your poorly formatted wages dataset! 

If only there was an AI that you could throw this mess into that would pass on the cat images to an AI upscaler and the dataset to a wages predictor AI!

No worries, OverlordAI is here to help. It will choose a suitable existing AI from this list (insert link to list here) to process your data!

The idea behind this AI is to find a suitable AI for a large amount of datasets with varying and/or unknown data types. 

This can be used to help people with little to know knowledge about AI explore existing AI and/or help people who are somewhat more experienced with AI find a suitable AI for their data easier and faster.

## Why Overlord AI?
The name "Overlord AI" came from the idea of having one AI rule over several others, making them the ruler or "overlord".

## How to get started
click run I guess, I have no clue since at this point I haven't written a single line of code.

## Where to get help
Ever heard of stackOverflow? good luck.
