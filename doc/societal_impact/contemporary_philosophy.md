# Impact of an AI to choose AI

## Introduction
In this document I will explore the potential social impact of my personal project, which consists of an AI which will recommend another AI to process the input data.

## 1. My philosophical standpoint
During a workshop I was provided with a list of philosophical theories:
1. Virtue Ethics
2. Consequentialism
3. Deontology
4. Nihilism
5. Pragmatism
6. Stoicism
7. Existentialism
8. Determinism
9. Free will
10. Negative theology
11. Semiotics

I feel like I resonate the most with Pragmatism, as this theory focusses mostly on what is practical.

This is because if I make something practical for a lot of people, that means it will likely be appreciated and used more often.

## 2. The social impact of my project

Potential positive impacts of my project could consist of, but are not limited to:
- Improve ease of use of AI for AI consultants/data scientists
- More people getting interested in using AI

Potential negative impacts of my project could be:
- Making the jobs of AI consultatns/data scientists (partially) obsolete by making it too easy

Overall, in my opinion this project will likely not cause much harm, as it mainly aims to provide recommendations and not completely replace existing jobs. The data will still need to be processed according to the standards set by the recommended script(s) and may not provide the desired result so the AI consultants and data scientists still have something to do.

However, if this project advances beyond a point where external intervention is needed to process datasets it could have an impact on related jobs. This is very unlikely though, as I have seen multiple papers on researchers trying to achieve a similar goal(see [AutoML](https://www.automl.org/book/)) which have not managed to achieve this yet.

My AI will also not be versatile enough, as training such an AI will take way too long considering the enormous diversity of the scripts available on kaggle. Because of this, my AI focusses mainly on one subcategory for now.
