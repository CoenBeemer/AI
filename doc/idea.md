# Personal project proposition 
## Concept 
For this personal project I plan to make an AI which can predict the IGN rating of a game by looking at features such as the developer, franchise and genres.

## What problem does it solve? 
I believe it can be useful for game developers to predict the IGN rating, as they can maybe use that to improve the game and get higher ratings.

## How does it solve it? 
The AI starts by looking at features of the game, such as the developer, game features and more.

## Who is it for? 
This AI can be used by game developers to estimate the ratings of their game.

## Why is my solution the best? 
It can help making games better before they're even released

## How is AI/data used? 
It is used to make a prediction how the game will be received by reviewers 

## What data(sets) does it use? 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/advancedforestry/ign-scores-dataset 
A dataset with details of all the games that have a review in the IGN website. The last scraped game was Return to Monkey Island, reviewed on September 19, 2022.

## What is the possible positive and negative impact? 
This could help developers get an idea of how their game will re received. 
However, they could try to focus too much on what this AI thinks and there are a lot of features it doesn't take into account such as for example storyline quality. 
This could lead to a bad game with a high estimated score, which is pretty bad for the developers.
